# 100 Days Of Code
For those who are new to coding or those that want to brush up on their skills, it can be a daunting process. I've seen experienced programmers break out in sweat when trying to learn a new language. With this project, I wanted to challenge myself and see how long I could stay focused on coding for 100 consecutive days.
This my second attempt at a 100 day challenge. I'm hoping to see how far I can go in this direction.
I'll update he Repository with more details as I continue to learn more about the journey as i go.
